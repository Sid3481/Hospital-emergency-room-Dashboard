# Hospital-emergency-room-Dashboard
Designed an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze hospital emergency room performance, using DAX and advanced formulas to deliver real-time KPIs on patient flow, wait times, and satisfaction.

Excel Dashboard Project â€“ Hospital Emergency Room Analysis

Iâ€™m excited to share my latest project where I built a fully interactive Excel dashboard to analyze hospital emergency room operations. This assignment was part of a hands-on learning journey guided by Satish Dhawale, and it challenged me to apply end-to-end skillsâ€”from data cleaning to dashboard design.

ðŸ”§ What I built and analyzed:
â€¢	Admission Trends: Tracked admitted vs. non-admitted patients
â€¢	Age Group Distribution: Analyzed patient volumes by age segments
â€¢	Timeliness of Care: Measured how quickly patients were seen
â€¢	Gender Breakdown: Visualized gender-wise patient flow
â€¢	Referral Patterns: Highlighted top referring departments

ðŸ“Œ Key KPIs and Tools:
â€¢	Total Patient Count with trend insights (sparklines)
â€¢	Average Wait Time with daily performance tracking
â€¢	Patient Satisfaction Score tied to operational performance
â€¢	Used Excel formulas and DAX logic to drive insights

This project deepened my skills in data visualization, dashboard storytelling, and Excel analytics â€” skills Iâ€™m excited to bring into real-world data roles.
